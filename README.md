Sure! Here's an example README file in Markdown format for a Rust project that implements the `grep` utility:

# Rust Grep

This is a command-line utility that implements the `grep` command in Rust. It allows you to search for a pattern in one or more files and print the matching lines.

## Installation

To install the utility, you need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. If you don't have them installed already, you can download and install them from the official Rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

Once you have Rust and Cargo installed, you can clone this repository and build the project using the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/deepak-likes-code/mini-grep.git
cd mini-grep
cargo build --release
```

The `--release` flag tells Cargo to build the project with optimizations enabled, which should result in a faster executable.

## Usage

To use the `mini-grep` utility, run the following command:

```
<IGNORE_CASE=1> cargo run <pattern> <file>
```

Replace `<pattern>` with the pattern you want to search for, and `<file(s)>` with the name(s) of the file(s) you want to search in. You can specify multiple files by separating them with spaces.

For example, to search for the word "hello" in a file called `example.txt`, you would run the following command:

```
cargo run hello example.txt
```

This would print all the lines in `example.txt` that contain the word "hello".
